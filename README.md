# SoundFinder
This program takes a Spotify song of interest as input and returns a list of similar songs based on Spotify's unique quantification of a song's "audio features." (still a work in progress)


#### To use (must have Spotify account):
1. Download charts.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts and ensure it's in the same path
2. Create an "app" on Spotify's developer page. You'll need the API credentials 
3. Create .env file with your CLIENT_ID='...' and CLIENT_SECRET='...' from Spotify developer app credentials
