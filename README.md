# SoundFinder
This program takes a Spotify song of interest as input and returns a list of similar songs based on Spotify's unique quantification of a song's "audio features." (still a work in progress)


#### To use (must have Spotify account):
1. Dowload the zip file from GitHub (Click 'Code' drop down)
2. Open up the terminal (or use an IDE) and type "unzip name-of-zip-you-just-downloaded"
3. Download charts.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts and ensure it's in that same folder.
4. Create an "app" on Spotify's developer page. You'll need the API credentials. 
5. Create a file named '.env' with CLIENT_ID='...' and CLIENT_SECRET='...' from Spotify developer app credentials
